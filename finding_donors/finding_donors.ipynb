    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Given the models I chose to test, I’m going to choose the Gradient Boosted Tree model. Given the Accuracy and F score skewed more towards Recall, the GBT model performed more consistently against Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The reason I chose a higher beta is because we care more about the actual income of individuals more than the accuracy of our predictions; we want to guess the individuals who have > 50K income. \n",

    "Decision Trees take advantage of feature selection and thus can perform efficiently by selecting the important features out of all that are available. Because we’ve dummied a lot of our features because they are categorical, we can benefit from drastically reducing dimensionality/complexity of our model by using GBT to select only the binary variables that are significant. This is reflective across all model evaluation metrics as it performs better than Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in almost every way.\n"

    "We've developped a Machine Learning model to help your organization identify the right individuals that have the most likelihood of donating. Based on your business requirements, we've come to a consensus that individuals who have income greater than $50,000 are more likely to donate to your cause. Our model evaluates features about those individuals to determine if someone earns that much. This means that there are qualities and attribute of each person that will make them more likely to donate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to predict the income variable which indicates if someone earns more than $50,000. We've chosen a decision tree as the model of choice our ML Challenge. This is because we believe there are boundary points based on the attributes of each individual that separate people who earn more than 50000 a year, and those who earn less. The algorithm attempts the split the data based on a those variables to determine what's important to predicting income. One of the advantages of Gradient Tree Boosting is that is not sensitive to outliers, and because the data that you supplied has capital-gain/loss variables (and while we've done our best to normalize that data) we believed this was the right algorithm for the job. We're using a boosted version of decision trees called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees. Essentially, we use multiple decision trees and combine these iterations into a stronger model.

    "The 5 featuers I would guess would be education number, capital gain, race, native-country, and age. I picked education number, capital gain and age because they are numeric variables. I believe these variables are significant in separating the data specifically capital gain and education because capital gain shows how much money someone has made with investments and therefor may or may not have more disposable income. Someone with a lot of capital gains way want to offset their taxes with benefits from charitable donations. Someone with high education will probably earn more money and therefor are more likely to donate. Also, the older someone is, the more savings they've accumulated, the more established they are in the workforce, and have more flexibility over their finances than a new grad. For the categorical variables, I believe their may be a binary, significant difference in race because we live in a society that has bias. Some races, given the country, have privilege and therefor are more well off because of their socio-economic status due to race. The last variable of native-country is correlated with the last categorical variable, as someone who is not native to the country of the charity may not have more disposable income to donate because they are trying to establish their financial base in the immigrated country."

    "I predicited 3 features correctly because of the reasons i listed above, numeric variables allow you to associate weights a lot more effectively. Age, capital gain and education were variables that were associated as the most important. \n",

    "The two variables I did not select, marital-status_married-civ-spouse and capital-loss are both interesting results. Cpaital gains and captial loss are very highlight inversely correlated with out other, so I'm not surprised to see it as an important before because it explains the reason why capital gains is. If someone who lost a lot of money that year on their investments, will not have a high propensity to donate because they are worse off. Marital status, specifically Married-civ-spouse, is an interesting feature because it is the only categorical variable in the top 5. This is a very interesting finding because this 1 binary variable is the 2nd most important feature. This may be due to the fact that their household has 2 incomes, and therefor the individual has twice as much income and more likely to donate (on behalf of the 2 people in the household). This makes intuitive sense as that one individual is making a decision on behalf of 2 people, therefor almost doupling their income. "

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model still does a very good job and the accuracy only dropped from 87.09% to 85.83%. This accuracy ressembles very much the accuracy and f-score of the unoptimized model, but uses only 5 features. This means that our model generalizes well, does not overtly overfit our problem, and has low dimentionality. Because our best_estimator_ had significant training time, I would elect to select the new, optimized, feature-selected model because we want to have as simple of a model as possible to avoid overfitting our data and losing predictive power with new observations. Because we barely lost any Accuracy or F-score, I believe there is no question to select the more simple model as it is more easy to explain to the client, and allows us to have less of a black box mentality when it comes to Machine Learning and Data Scientist. We can be more confident in our analysis that these are the features/factors that effect our outcome and can focus on exogenous ways to optimize those factors.
